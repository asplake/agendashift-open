# Agendashift as framework

[![Framework image][framework.image]][framework]

These pages describe Agendashift – the *[wholehearted]* engagement model – as an open framework for continuous, outcome-oriented transformation.

Agendashift is primarily for agents of strategic change, and it’s designed to be used with or without an explicit Lean-Agile agenda. In the Lean-Agile case it is intended neither as a replacement for the likes of Scrum, Kanban, or SAFe, nor as a way to choose between them. We’re not against such frameworks; as pluralists, we celebrate them as demonstrations of what’s possible and as sources of patterns that can be combined in interesting and innovative ways. What we’re against is their imposition – so contradictory as to invite failure.

We want to help you avoid yet another failed or utterly disappointing implementation, and we don’t pretend to be neutral. Outcome-orientation is not a neutral stance. Our commitment to participation and our opposition to imposition aren’t neutral either. If some of Agendashift’s principled approach to strategy and change rubs off in other areas too, we’d be delighted. Perhaps yours can be a [wholehearted] organisation too!

The framework’s main elements are its principles, patterns, and core activities (below). Running through those, a golden thread: [the language of outcomes].

## Distilled essence of Agendashift in five principles

## Two key generative patterns

  1. [Ideal, Obstacles, Outcomes (Idoo)]
  2. [Right-to-Left Strategy Deployment]  

Understand those two patterns, [how they relate to each other][patterns], and how they challenge the status quo, and you’re a long way towards understanding both how Agendashift works and why it exists.
