# Agendashift as framework

[![Framework overview image][framework.image]][framework]

These pages describe Agendashift – the *[wholehearted]* engagement model – as an open framework for continuous, outcome-oriented transformation.

 Agendashift is primarily for use by agents of strategic change, with or without an explicit Lean-Agile agenda. It is not intended as a replacement for the likes of Scrum, Kanban, or SAFe; neither do we consider it a way to choose between them. Our clear opposition to the imposition of frameworks on the unwilling does not make us anti-framework; rather we’re pluralists, celebrating frameworks as exemplars and sources of patterns that combine in interesting ways.

 We don’t however pretend to be neutral. **Outcome-orientation is not a neutral stance**. If these pages give you a fresh perspective on other frameworks and help you avoid yet another failed or mediocre implementation, that’s definitely for the better. Moreover, it’s not hard to see that whole system engagement and strategy deployment are useful models for delivery in complex environments.

 The framework’s main elements:

  *  Distilled essence of Agendashift in [five principles][principles]: 

	  1. Start – and finish – with needs
	  2. Agree on outcomes
	  3. Make the agenda for change visible
	  4. Manage options, testing assumptions
	  5. Organise for leverage and learning
	  
 *  Its core activities organised and explained by [two key generative patterns][patterns]: 

	  1. [Ideal, Obstacles, Outcomes (Idoo)][idoo]
	  2. [Just-in-time Strategy Deployment]

	Understand those two patterns, how they relate to each other, and how they challenge the status quo, and you’re a long way towards understanding both how Agendashift works and why it exists. 

 *  [Five core activities][core_activities], described in the pages below as workshop sessions that prime the pump for the longer term: 

	  1. [Discovery]
	  2. [Exploration]
	  3. [Mapping]
	  4. [Elaboration]
	  5. [Operation]
	  
 * And running through those, a golden thread: [the language of outcomes].
 
 The Agendashift framework is open source, its definitions and many of its resources released under a CC-BY-SA license. Under the terms of that license, contributions, spinoffs, and derivative works are welcomed. We in turn are glad to celebrate our sources:
