# Agendashift as framework

These pages describe Agendashift – the *[wholehearted]* engagement model – as an open framework for continuous, outcome-oriented transformation. Its top level elements are its **strategies**, **generative patterns**, the **agenda for change**, and **core activities**. Through those run a golden thread, the language of outcomes.


## Strategies

In the form of three questions, three leadership principles and meta strategies – strategies for getting better at the kinds of strategy that tend to drive transformation:

As text:

<blockquote style="background-color: #F1FCFF; border-left: none;">
    <ol>
        <li><b>What if we put <i>agreement on outcomes</i> ahead of solutions?</b></li>
        <li><b>How do we keep bringing outcomes to the foreground?</b></li>
        <li><b>Where – and where else – could we be developing and pursuing strategy?</b></li>
    </ol>
</blockquote>

Our prefered starting point (of several) is authentic agreement on meaningful outcomes – the right people in the room, outcomes articulated in the participants’ own words and organised coherently into strategy.

To keep outcomes in the foreground, we teach some straightforward ways to improve existing feedback opportunities or to add them where they are lacking. This too is a potential starting point.

As for where to do strategy, the opportunities are typically plentiful and easy to recognise. Where it’s needed, explicitly inside-out and/or outside-in forms of strategy may be appropriate, the former beginning with the internal experience and capability of the scope in question, the latter starting with its external relationships.

## Generative patterns

Supporting the strategies, three [generative patterns][patterns] – non-prescriptive, repeatable, and recognisable structures into which a range of conversational and organisational tools can easily be inserted:

  1. [Ideal, Obstacles, Outcomes (IdOO)]
  2. [Meaning before metric, measure before method (2MBM)][2MBM]
  3. [Right-to-Left Strategy Deployment]

## The agenda for change

From the 2nd edition of _Agendashift_ (2021):

> [The] agenda for change doesn’t start with a solution idea or a “target state” design. It is made principally of outcomes and the relationships between outcomes, and it is created, developed, and maintained through participation. It’s an expression of shared understanding and strategy that unfolds and evolves as the organisation learns.

## Core activities

The core activities provide teachable and repeatable demonstrations of the patterns, using some of our favourite tools. NB: Other structures and tool choices are encouraged!
