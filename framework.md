# Agendashift as framework

These pages describe Agendashift – the *[wholehearted]* engagement model – as an open framework for continuous, outcome-oriented transformation. Its top level elements are its **strategies**, **generative patterns**, the **agenda for change**, and **core activities**. Through those run a golden thread, the language of outcomes.


## Strategies

Leadership principles and meta strategies – strategies for getting better at the kinds of strategy that tend to drive transformation:

As text:

> 1. Keep asking the <i>agreement on outcomes</i> question<sup>1</sup>
> 2. Keep bringing outcomes to the foreground
> 3. Keep finding new places for strategy to happen
>
> <sup>1</sup><i>What if we put agreement on outcomes before solutions?</i>


## Generative patterns

Supporting the strategies, three [generative patterns][patterns] – non-prescriptive, repeatable, and recognisable structures into which a range of conversational and organisational tools can easily be inserted:

  1. [Ideal, Obstacles, Outcomes (IdOO)]
  2. [Meaning before metric, measure before method (2MBM)][2MBM]
  3. [Right-to-Left Strategy Deployment]

## The agenda for change

From the 2nd edition of _Agendashift_ (2021):

> [The] agenda for change doesn’t start with a solution idea or a “target state” design. It is made principally of outcomes and the relationships between outcomes, and it is created, developed, and maintained through participation. It’s an expression of shared understanding and strategy that unfolds and evolves as the organisation learns.

## Core activities

The core activities provide teachable and repeatable demonstrations of the patterns, using some of our favourite tools. NB: Other structures and tool choices are encouraged!
