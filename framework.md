# Agendashift as framework

These pages describe Agendashift – the *[wholehearted]* engagement model upon which [Leading with Outcomes](https://academy.agendashift.com/c/leading-with-outcomes) is built – as an open framework for continuous, outcome-oriented transformation.

Its top level elements are its **strategies**, **generative patterns**, and the **agenda for change**. Of somewhat less importance are the **core activities** that package up many of the tools and exercises for which Agendashift is known. Through all of those run a golden thread, the language of outcomes.


## Principles

In the form of three questions, three leadership principles and meta strategies – strategies for getting better at the kinds of strategy that tend to drive transformation:

As text:

<blockquote style="background-color: #F1FCFF; border-left: none;">
    <ol>
        <li><b>What if we put <i>agreement on outcomes</i> before solutions?</b></li>
        <li><b>How do we keep bringing outcomes to the foreground?</b></li>
        <li><b>Where – and where else – should we be engaging?</b></li>
    </ol>
</blockquote>

Each of those represents a possible starting point:

 1. Authentic agreement on meaningful outcomes – the right people in the room, outcomes articulated in the participants’ own words and organised coherently into strategy
 2. Paying attention to the role of outcomes in the organisation's everyday and longer-cadence feedback opportunities; developing containers for innovation and learning
 3. Recognising the range of scales and scopes (existing or potential) in which such conversations could happen – identifying which challenges to engage on and who to invite, ready to celebrate their successes¹

## Generative patterns

Supporting the strategies, three [generative patterns][patterns] – non-prescriptive, repeatable, and recognisable structures into which a range of conversational and organisational tools can easily be inserted:

  1. [Ideal, Obstacles, Outcomes (IdOO)]
  2. [Meaning, Measure, Method][patterns__meaning_measure_method]
  3. [Right-to-Left Strategy Deployment] (or simply *Right to Left*)

## The agenda for change

From the 2nd edition of _Agendashift_ (2021):

> [The] agenda for change doesn’t start with a solution idea or a “target state” design. It is made principally of outcomes and the relationships between outcomes, and it is created, developed, and maintained through participation and experimentation. It’s an expression of shared understanding and strategy that unfolds and evolves as the organisation learns.
