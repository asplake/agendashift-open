# Agendashift as framework

[![Framework overview image][framework.image]][framework]

These pages describe Agendashift – the *[wholehearted]* engagement model – as an open framework for continuous, outcome-oriented transformation.

Agendashift is primarily for agents of strategic change, and can be used with or without an explicit Lean-Agile agenda. It is intended neither as a replacement for the likes of Scrum, Kanban, or SAFe, nor as a way to choose between them. With regard to those, we’re not against frameworks but pluralists, celebrating them as demonstrations of what’s possible and as sources of patterns that can be combined in interesting and innovative ways.

We want to help you avoid yet another failed or utterly mediocre implementation, and we don’t pretend to be neutral. Outcome-orientation is not a neutral stance. We’re not neutral either in our commitment to participation and our opposition to imposition. If some of Agendashift’s principled approach to strategy and change rubs off in other areas too, we’d be delighted. Perhaps yours can be a [wholehearted] organisation too!

The framework’s main elements:

  * Distilled essence of Agendashift in [five principles][principles]: 

      1. Start – and finish – with needs
      2. Agree on outcomes
      3. Make the agenda for change visible
      4. Manage options, testing assumptions
      5. Organise for leverage and learning
      
  * Its core activities organised and explained by [two key generative patterns][patterns]: 

      1. [Ideal, Obstacles, Outcomes (Idoo)]
      2. [Just-in-time Strategy Deployment]  

    Understand those two patterns, how they relate to each other, and how they challenge the status quo, and you’re a long way towards understanding both how Agendashift works and why it exists.

  * [Five core activities][core_activities], described in the pages below as workshop sessions that prime the pump for the longer term: 

      1. [Discovery]
      2. [Exploration]
      3. [Mapping]
      4. [Elaboration]
      5. [Operation]
      
  * And running through those, a golden thread: [the language of outcomes].
