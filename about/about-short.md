## About Agendashift™, the wholehearted, outcome-oriented engagement model

### In the vanguard of a new category, the *engagement model*

You can’t upgrade your organisation like you’re upgrading your email server! Traditional change management’s track record on cultural and other adaptive challenges is so disastrous that it’s time to carve out a new category, the *engagement model*.

Engagement models have just three jobs to do:

  1. To structure and support the work of those who would encourage innovation, change, and transformation
  2. To help the organisation engage its staff meaningfully in change-related work
  3. To keep the organisation’s parts engaged with each other as they change

If any of those jobs are yours too, you’d want an approach that encourages engagement, not destroys it! 

### Outcomes all the way down, *outcome-oriented*

Agendashift deals coherently, humanely, and strategically with outcomes ranging from the most aspirational of goals to the impact of the smallest experiment, and everything in between. With outcomes generated, organised, and developed through participation, agreement on outcomes is a natural part of the process; solutions follow as they should on a just-in-time basis.

Because we enjoy its broad range, we prefer not to define *outcome* too tightly. Here though are some helpful starting points:

  * Someone’s need met (see also our [definition of done][done] and the first of our [principles])
  * A story’s happy ending
  * The way the world changed for someone

Shared examples of outcomes such as these – both real and imagined – help to connect everyday work to mission, purpose, and strategy. That’s what makes outcomes so powerful!

### We’re in the business of building wholehearted organisations

Our mission: Helping organisations grow in wholeheartedness – to become less at war with themselves, their obstacles, imbalances, and contradictions identified and owned, value and meaning created through authentic engagement.
