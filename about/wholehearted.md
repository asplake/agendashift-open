# About: Our mission: Wholehearted

**Our mission**: Helping organisations grow in wholeheartedness – to become less at war with themselves, their obstacles, imbalances, and contradictions identified and owned, value and meaning created through authentic engagement.

*Wholehearted* describes both a vision to pursue and something we can help you experience right away: people engaging on issues that matter, articulating outcomes in their own words, co-creating a coherent way forward. It’s what we do!

The words picked out in bold suggest some values:

  * **Authentic engagement** – open, transparent, curious, listening; true to ourselves and respectful of others
  * **Meaningful participation** – maximising the opportunity for people to contribute to conversations of real consequence
  * Attention to **needs** and **outcomes** – not just hollow promises of future benefits but a fundamental reorientation, a paradigm shift, and a change of language
  * **Leadership** at every level – facilitating all of the above, responsible and accountable for it

Many and varied are the obstacles that we have helped organisations think and work their way beyond, but these are common:

  * Strategy, objectives, accountabilities, or performance inadequately defined or understood</li>
  * Gaps between demand and capacity or between expectation and capability (often these go together)</li>
  * Customer involvement in the process – whether too little or too much of an unhelpful kind</li>
  * Slowness in bringing forward innovation in product, service, technology, or process</li>

Being both [needs-based][principles] and [outcome-oriented][outcome_oriented] means that we don’t just settle for quick fixes to obvious problems. Neither – and despite our undoubted expertise – do we seek to impose our designs on others uninvited. Rather, we help you identify, articulate, and understand your *“ideal best”* in the context of where you are now, and vice versa. That way, you find both opportunity and direction, and keep the two connected.

**Where we’re coming from**: Agendashift’s founders, partners, collaborators, supporters, and champions work at the exciting intersection of Lean-Agile, Strategy, and Organisation Development, are growing into that space, or see its potential for their organisations.

**What sets us apart**: a fundamentally needs-based and outcome-oriented approach to strategy, development (change), and delivery that helps people to [engage][engagement_model] meaningfully on the issues that matter, to pay explicit and continuous attention to needs and outcomes, and to energise, inform, and sustain this process through participation.

**The challenge that motivates us**: When any of these crucial elements go missing, the organisation exposes itself to the familiar risks of solution-driven and process-centric approaches: mediocrity, disappointment, and (most damaging of all) disengagement. Ironically, many change management approaches exacerbate the very problems they are called upon to solve; no wonder then that so many change initiatives fail. Isn’t it time we left those tired old ways behind?

**Let’s do this thing together!** Inviting us to work with your organisation is a small act of leadership and staff engagement that generates plenty more of both in return. What a great investment!

We’re wholehearted – are you?


## Inspiration

The original inspiration for our characteristically needs-based and outcome-oriented use of the word *wholehearted* is this short paragraph from a classic book, *The Timeless Way of Building*, by the renowned architect Christopher Alexander:

> *A thing is whole according to how free it is of inner contradictions. When it is at war with itself, and gives rise to forces which act to tear it down, it is unwhole. The more free it is of its own inner contradictions, the more whole and healthy and wholehearted it becomes.*
>
> *The Timeless Way of Building*, Christopher Alexander (1980, OUP USA)

On the surface at least, Alexander is writing about the design of buildings and the built environment. However, deeply struck by the metaphor and its application to organisation design, in my 2019 book *Right to Left* I wrote this:

> *I love the idea that as leaders and trusted advisers we can choose to be in the business of helping organisations to be more* wholehearted *... (If) we improve our delivery processes by removing impediments to flow, then we improve our organisations by removing impediments to alignment.*
>
> *I choose this! Do you?*
