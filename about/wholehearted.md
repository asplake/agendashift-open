As text:

> **Our mission: To help organisations grow in wholeheartedness**
>
> Continously renewing themselves from the inside:
> 
> * **Engaging openly** on all that would make them unwhole – their challenges, imbalances, and contradictions
> * **Inviting participation** in every dimension of the strategy process – developing it, pursuing it, finding new opportunities for it
> * **Celebrating** the **initiative** of those closest to the need and the opportunity

**Where we’re coming from**: Agendashift’s founders, partners, collaborators, supporters, and champions work at the exciting intersection of (Lean-Agile) Delivery, Strategy, and Organisation Development, are growing into that space, or see its potential for their organisations.

**What sets us apart**: a fundamentally *[outcome-oriented][outcome_oriented]* approach. Outcomes identified, articulated, and organised strategically through participation. Outcomes kept in the foreground, solutions following, emerging at the right time and the right scale from the people closest to the problem. Not for us the solution-driven rollout, a source of failure and dysfunction when applied in the context of cultural and other adaptive challenges.

**The challenge that motivates us**: We see too many organisations expose themselves to the familiar risks of the conventional approaches to change: mediocrity, disappointment, and (most damaging of all) disengagement. Ironically, they often exacerbate the very problems that they are called upon to solve; no wonder then that so many change initiatives fail. Isn’t it time we left those tired old ways behind?

**Actionable at every level of organisation**: *Wholehearted* is not just a dream. Whatever the level of organisation you operate at, there's plenty you can do to make it a reality. In yourself and in others you can develop the skills of the outcome-oriented strategy conversation. You can practice keeping outcomes in the foreground, creating both the space for impactful innovation and the sense of meaningful progress. You can learn to recognise the richness of opportunity that your organisation represents.

## Inspiration

The original inspiration for our characteristically needs-based and outcome-oriented use of the word *wholehearted* is this short paragraph from a classic book, *The Timeless Way of Building*, by the renowned architect Christopher Alexander:

> *A thing is whole according to how free it is of inner contradictions. When it is at war with itself, and gives rise to forces which act to tear it down, it is unwhole. The more free it is of its own inner contradictions, the more whole and healthy and wholehearted it becomes.*
>
> *The Timeless Way of Building*, Christopher Alexander (1980, OUP USA)

On the surface at least, Alexander is writing about the design of buildings and the built environment. However, deeply struck by the metaphor and its application to organisation design, in my 2019 book *Right to Left* I wrote this:

> *I love the idea that as leaders and trusted advisers we can choose to be in the business of helping organisations to be more* wholehearted *... (If) we improve our delivery processes by removing impediments to flow, then we improve our organisations by removing impediments to alignment.*
>
> *I choose this! Do you?*
