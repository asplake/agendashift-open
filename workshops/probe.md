Described by one participant as *”A3 for the 2020’s"*, the *Probe!* workshop is a standalone and enhanced version of our strategy workshops’ [Elaboration] \(ideation and experimentation) activity, as covered in chapter 4 of the Agendashift [book][agendashift]. It features one of our most popular resources, the [Agendashift Experiment A3 Template][experiment_a3], and exciting new material from the *[Impact!]* and [Wholehearted:OKR] workshops.

Topics and exercises:

  * Stories and their authentic situations of need
  * Hypotheses “hard” and “soft”
  * Just-in-time option selection
  * Challenge Mapping¹
  * Generating 15% Solutions²
  * Framing ideas as hypotheses
  * Developing experiments with the [Agendashift Experiment A3 Template][experiment_a3] (see below)
  * Patterns: [Meaning, Measure, Method][patterns__meaning_measure_method], [IdOO], and [Right-to-Left Strategy Deployment]
