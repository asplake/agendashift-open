# Outside-in Strategy Workshops

Our second family of workshops, as introduced in *[Agendashift]* (2nd edition 2021) and developed in *[Right to Left]* (2019, audiobook 2020):

  * [Wholehearted:OKR – Integrating strategy, development, and delivery] – understanding and implementing OKR
  * [Impact! Story, strategy, and outcomes for products and services] – Agendashift for product people
  * [Agendashift Outside-in Strategy Review (OI-SR)] – the essential strategy review workshop that inspired the other two

All our workshops can be delivered online, typically over multiple days in sessions of up to two hours each.

### 1. [Wholehearted:OKR – Integrating strategy, development, and delivery]

This 2-day / 8-session workshop uses the outside-in strategy review as a safe and effective way to approach Objectives and Key Results (OKR). Get the benefits, avoid the dysfunctions, and begin to see your organisation differently. [More...][wholehearted_okr]

### 2. [Impact! Story, strategy, and outcomes for products and services]

A 1-day Agendashift workshop for product people. Different expressions of user need; managing your portfolio of experiments; thinking strategically about product evolution; options, hypotheses, and experiments. [More...][impact]

### 3. [Agendashift Outside-in Strategy Review (OI-SR)]

A private strategy review, typically as a 1-day workshop. It is also the platform on which the *Impact!* and Wholehearted:OKR workshops are built. [More...][outside_in_strategy_review]

## Public or private?

With the exception of the private-only outside-in strategy review workshop (the platform for the others), all workshops are offered both publicly and privately. Private workshops represent an important opportunity to review and develop strategy; public workshops are more about the approach and techniques.

Your workshop will be facilitated by an Agendashift partner, the majority of whom are listed in our [partner directory]. Our unlisted partners typically work exclusively within a single client organisation (often their employer), enabling self-service access to the full range of tools and materials.
