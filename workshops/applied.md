# Applied Agendashift: Co-Creating Your Transformation Strategy

> *“Not only did we learn some good techniques, more important was the quite unexpected 180° shift in awareness and thinking in our management team”*

Working collaboratively, create a transformation plan for your organisation based on a shared understanding of how things are, the opportunities for future development, and the outcomes essential to your success. Working on things that really matter to your organisation, practice some powerful techniques from Clean Language, Lean Startup, A3, Cynefin, and Kanban. It’s is a great way to scope, launch, or re-energise your Lean-Agile transformation.

The [Agendashift delivery assessment][assessments] is typically set as pre-work for this workshop. In keeping with the assessment, the workshop is light on jargon and prescription and strong on inclusivity and honest reflection. Most of all, it is about opportunities, outcomes, alignment, and action.

## Who should attend?

  * Leadership teams, as an organisational strategy exercise
  * Audiences of mixed seniority, eg CxO, managers, and frontline staff for an in-depth transformation planning exercise
  * Delivery teams, to learn new techniques and to explore improvement opportunities

For a version of this workshop aimed at practitioners (coaches, consultants, etc), see [Core Agendashift: Facilitating Outcome-Oriented Change][core], and for an in-depth 2-day workshop see [Agendashift Deep Dive: Coaching and Leading Continuous Transformation][deep_dive]. See also our [outside-in strategy workshops], in particular *[Impact!]* and [Wholehearted:OKR].

## Typical structure

For a full day workshop (talk to us if you'd like something shorter or spread over a longer period):

  * [Discovery]: Explore strategic objectives, obstacles, outcomes, change strategies
  * [Exploration]: Debrief your Agendashift delivery assessment, agree scope
  * [Mapping]: Build a transformation plan
  * [Elaboration]: Generate, frame, and develop actions

Note: [Operation], chapter 5 of the book, is no longer part of our 1-day workshops but may be covered by agreed support activities and is included in some of our other workshops, most especially [Wholehearted:OKR] and [Implementing your Outside-in Service Delivery Review (OI-SDR)].

## Workshop Outcomes

  * Agreement on a way forward, developed to the level required to meet the expectations of workshop sponsors and participants
  * Agreement on priority areas and immediate actions
  * Shared awareness of organisational context in the shape of objectives, challenges, problems, desired outcomes, and their relevance to the transformation process
  * Exposure – in a natural and experiential way rather than anything “teachy” – to a range of techniques and concepts from Lean-Agile, Kanban, Clean Language, Cynefin, Lean Startup, and A3.
