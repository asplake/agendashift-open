# Agendashift Deep Dive: Coaching and Leading Continuous Transformation

The Agendashift Deep Dive workshop ‘Coaching and leading continuous transformation’ is the Agendashift engagement model delivered in the form a highly immersive 2-day workshop. It is aimed at coaches, consultants, and managers wishing to:

  * Develop their coaching and leadership skills in the areas of enquiry, facilitation, strategy deployment, and change leadership
  * Broaden and deepen their appreciation of the Lean-Agile landscape and related bodies of knowledge and their strategic application to organisational development

It is run both publicly and privately; see the [Events calendar][events] for upcoming public workshops.

## Who should attend?

The Deep Dive workshop is aimed at all agents and leaders of organisational change – whether internal or external, specialist practitioner or sponsor. Whilst the majority of attendees have been coaches and consultants, a significant number have held managerial and business leadership roles.

Public workshops are focussed primarily on skills. You will however have ample opportunity to put them into your organisational context and demonstrate Agendashift’s ability to meet organisational needs in ways such as these:

  * Launching, refocusing, or reenergising continuous transformation in your organisation
  * Enhancing your organisation’s internal coaching and change management capability
  * Embedding outcome-orientation and continuous transformation through leadership development

Private workshops allow greater emphasis on producing of artefacts of real value to the organisation. Their production involves both new conversations and new kinds of conversation, and we look for opportunities to sustain those beyond the workshop itself.

## Workshop Outcomes

  * Practice in a range of outcome-oriented facilitation techniques
  * Recognition of the role of outcome orientation in the modern organisation
  * Understanding of the integration of techniques and concepts from Lean-Agile, Kanban, Clean Language, Cynefin, Lean Startup, and A3
  * Awareness of the power of feedback loops in organisational behaviour and evolution

Participants in most public workshops (and private workshops by arrangement) will receive a print copy of the book *[Agendashift: Outcome-oriented change and continuous transformation]* (2nd edition 2021).

## Workshop facilitation

Your facilitator will be one of our most experienced partners, either Agendashift founder [Mike Burrows](/mike) or a close collaborator.
