# Learning the Language of Outcomes

Welcome to this short hands-on introduction to Agendashift, the *[wholehearted]* engagement model.

Engagement models have just three jobs to do:

  * Give structure to the work of change agents – people like you, wanting to see some strategic kind of change come to life
  * Help staff to engage meaningfully in the process
  * Keep the organisation engaged as it changes, its different parts at different speeds

Sadly, disengagement is the more likely result of conventional approaches to change when applied in complex environments – your organisation, for example. No wonder that so many change initiatives fail!

## Resolutely outcome-oriented, strategic in perspective

Agendashift offers a highly practical alternative to those embarrassingly linear models of solution-driven change: outcome orientation. With us, it’s outcomes all the way down: everything from the most aspirational of goals to the impact of a small experiment is an outcome. Crucially, outcomes precede solutions: authentic agreement on outcomes is the powerful enabler, options generated on a just-in-time basis, prioritised to advance a strategy that develops through participation.

## We’re in the business of building wholehearted organisations

Not only our stated [mission][wholehearted] and long-term vision, it can be your experience right away:

  * People engaging on the issues that matter – powerful tools uncovering the obstacles, imbalances, inefficiencies, and contradictions that get in the way
  * Diversity in participation and richness in response
  * Outcomes inviting leadership – and vice versa – meaning created through new conversations and new kinds of conversations, both the enabler and the evidence of fundamental change

## Learning the Language of Outcomes

This workshop is an opportunity to experience Agendashift's [Discovery] and [Exploration] activities (chapters 1 & 2 of the [book][agendashift]) in the form of a highly immersive online workshop. It is for coaches, consultants, and managers wishing to develop their coaching and leadership skills in the areas of enquiry, facilitation, and change leadership.

The two 2-hour sessions of this workshop will give you plenty of opportunity to practice [the language of outcomes] – conversations that explore needs and identify key outcomes – essential whenever and wherever you wish to encourage collaboration, self-organisation, and innovation. You will get practical hands-on experience with some exciting open source tools, including our popular kickoff exercise [Celebration-5W] and our signature coaching game, the Clean Language-inspired [15-minute FOTO]. Additionally, the [Agendashift delivery assessment][assessments] is set as prework for all participants a week or so prior to the workshop.
