# IdOO! Leading with Outcomes

This 2-session workshop is about leading with outcomes in the context of cultural and other adaptive challenges:

  * What it means to be outcome-oriented – putting outcomes first and avoiding the dysfunctions of solution-driven change management
  * How to speak the language of outcomes, an essential skill for leaders at all levels

At the heart of the *IdOO!* workshop is the [IdOO pattern][idoo], short for Ideal, Obstacles, Outcomes. Demonstrating its power for generative and strategic conversations we use this pattern twice, implementing it with a range of different tools over the two sessions.

Our short training workshops [Strategic Mapping with Outcomes] and *[Probe!]* are ideal followups to this workshop.

## About Agendashift™, the *wholehearted* engagement model

### Engagement model

You can’t upgrade your organisation like you’re upgrading your email server! Traditional change management’s track record on cultural and other adaptive challenges is so disastrous that it’s time to carve out a new category, the *engagement model*.

Engagement models have just three jobs to do:

  1. To structure and support the work of those who would encourage innovation, change, and transformation
  2. To help the organisation engage its staff meaningfully in change-related work
  3. To keep the organisation’s parts engaged with each other as they change

If any of those jobs are yours too, use an approach that encourages engagement, not destroys it! 

### Outcomes all the way down

Agendashift deals coherently, humanely, and strategically with outcomes ranging from the most aspirational of goals to the impact of the smallest experiment, and everything in between. With outcomes generated, organised, and developed through participation, agreement on outcomes is a natural part of the process; solutions follow as they should on a just-in-time basis.

Because we enjoy its broad range, we prefer not to define outcome too tightly. Here though are some helpful starting points:

  * Someone’s need met (see also our [definition of done][done] and the first of our [principles])
  * A story’s happy ending
  * The way the world changed for someone

Shared examples of outcomes such as these – both real and imagined – help to connect everyday work to mission, purpose, and strategy. That’s what makes outcomes so powerful!

### We’re in the business of building wholehearted organisations

Not only our stated [mission][wholehearted] and long-term vision, it can be your experience right away:

  * People engaging on the issues that matter – powerful tools uncovering the obstacles, imbalances, inefficiencies, and contradictions that get in the way
  * Diversity in participation and richness in response
  * Outcomes inviting leadership – and vice versa – meaning created through new conversations and new kinds of conversations, both the enabler and the evidence of fundamental change
