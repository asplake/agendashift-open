# IdOO! Leading with Outcomes

In this hands-on workshop we practice both meanings of *“Leading with outcomes”*:

  1. Putting outcomes before solutions, being *outcome-oriented*
  2. The language of outcomes as an essential leadership discipline

Also known as the *IdOO!* workshop, at its heart is the [IdOO pattern][idoo], short for Ideal, Obstacles, Outcomes. Demonstrating its power and flexibility we use this pattern twice, implementing it with a range of different tools over the two sessions.

Whatever your role, if you‘re in the business of encouraging innovation, change, and transformation – helping people engage meaningfully in change-related work – then this workshop is for you. Our short training workshops [Strategic Mapping with Outcomes] and *[Probe!]* are ideal followups.

Among this workshop’s sources and inspirations are Clean Language, Solutions Focus, Challenge Mapping, Lean, and Agile. The [Agendashift™ delivery assessment](assessments) is included in the second session.

Online, this participatory workshop is conducted ‘open mic’ via Zoom and Google Docs. Afterwards, participants receive a certificate of participation.
