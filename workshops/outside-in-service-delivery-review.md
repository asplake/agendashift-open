# Implementing your Outside-in Service Delivery Review (OI-SDR)

This 2-hour hands-on online workshop will get your team, product line, value stream, or organisational unit started with the Outside-in Service Delivery Review (OI-SDR), a strategic and Lean-Agile twist on the classic operational review meeting. Based on real experience in the UK government digital space, this key governance meeting is introduced in *[Agendashift: Outcome-oriented change and continuous transformation]* (2018), described in depth in *[Right to Left: The digital leader’s guide to Lean and Agile]* (2019), and referenced on this site in the [Just-in-time Strategy Deployment] pattern.

By the end of this workshop you will be well on your way to implementing your own OI-SDR successfully. With that, you will be building into your organisation design some powerful expectations: that experimentation will always be happening, that the strategy will be advancing, that service will continue to improve, and that intelligence and insights will be shared – all of that in a structure specifically designed to create leadership opportunities and to cause misalignments to reveal themselves.

Workshop agenda:

 1. **Thinking in circles**:
      * Interlinked circles of responsibility
      * Concentric circles of alignment
 2. **Metrics**:
      * Performance measures
      * Health indicators
 3. **Stories, hypotheses, and experiments**:
      * Framing for maximum learning
      * Focussing for maximum leverage
 4. **The nuts and bolts of the OI-SDR meeting**:
      * Agenda:
          * Outside in (customer & environment first), then
          * Right to left (outcome first)
      * Protocols, participation, and preparation

This workshop is a natural companion to our transformation strategy workshops and outside-in strategy review workshops; accordingly it may be offered as part of a package. These workshops can be taken in either order or standalone:

  * The OI-SDR workshop as groundwork before stepping back to strategy, whether focussed mainly on delivery and ways of working ([Applied] and [Deep Dive]), on customer/product/service strategy ([Impact!]), or on strategy more broadly ([Wholehearted:OKR])
  * The OI-SDR workshop as followup, establishing the infrastructure required to sustain the work agreed in a strategy review
  * The OI-SDR workshop on its own as an opportunity to improve the design of your organisational unit’s governance mechanisms, with a view to improving performance and alignment

By default, this workshop is delivered online for 3-8 participants from the same organisational unit – at least acquainted with each other if not close colleagues. However, of your needs differ from that, don’t hesitate to ask.
