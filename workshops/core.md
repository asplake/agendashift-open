# Core Agendashift: Facilitating outcome-oriented change

> *“Fantastic Agendashift workshop today. I’d recommend it to anyone responsible for organisational change”*

The Core Agendashift workshop ‘Facilitating outcome-oriented change’ provides a single-day pass through the Agendashift engagement model. It is aimed at coaches, consultants, and managers wishing to practice a range of outcome-centric facilitation techniques and develop awareness of the continuous transformation process.

It is run both publicly and privately; see the [Events calendar][events] for upcoming public workshops.

## Who should attend?

The core workshop is aimed at all agents and leaders of organisational change – whether internal or external, specialist practitioner or sponsor.

Public workshops are focussed primarily on skills. You will however have ample opportunity to put them into your organisational context and demonstrate Agendashift’s ability to meet organisational needs in ways such as these:

  * Launching, refocusing, or reenergising continuous transformation in your organisation
  * Enhancing your organisation’s internal coaching and change management capability
  * Embedding outcome-orientation and continuous transformation through leadership development

For private workshops, there is some choice in the balance between the focus on skills and on the production of artefacts of real value to the organisation. We use **Core** for mainly skills-focussed workshops and [Applied] where the goal is organisation development. The longer [Deep Dive] workshop provides space for both.

## Workshop outcomes

  * Practice in a range of outcome-oriented facilitation techniques
  * Recognition of the role of outcome orientation in the modern organisation
  * Understanding of the integration of techniques and concepts from Lean-Agile, Kanban, Clean Language, Cynefin, Lean Startup, and A3

## Workshop facilitation

Your facilitator will be one of our most experienced partners, either Agendashift founder [Mike Burrows](/mike) or a close collaborator.

## Workshop overview

Important note: Not every exercise can be covered in depth in a single day, and your facilitator will prioritise according to need. The Mapping exercises (session 3) are considered optional and may sacrificed in their entirety in favour of the [Changeban] game or to allow more time for Discovery. [Operation] \(chapter 5 of the book) is not typically included in 1-day workshops except for aspects combined with Elaboration as described below.

[![Framework overview image][framework.image]][framework]

### 1. [Discovery]: Describing where we'd like to get to

[![Discovery image][core_activities__discovery.image]][discovery]

Exploring organisational context, objectives, obstacles, and outcomes using these exercises:

  * [Celebration-5W]
  * [True North] / obstacles
  * [15-minute FOTO] \(Lite)
  * [Plan on a Page]

Discovery provides a great example of the generative pattern [Ideal, Obstacles, Outcomes (Idoo)].

### 2. [Exploration]: Prospecting for opportunities

[![Exploration image][core_activities__exploration.image]][exploration]

The opportunity to practice skills acquired in Discovery and to reinforce the IdOO pattern: 

  * Survey debrief / obstacles
  * [15-minute FOTO] \(Classic)

Both to provide input to this session and to set the tone for the workshop overall, the [Agendashift delivery assessment](assessments) is set in advance as prework.

### 3. [Mapping]: Building a visual transformation plan

[![Mapping image][core_activities__mapping.image]][mapping]

Typically just one of these mapping exercises, organising the outputs of Exploration:

  * Option Approach Mapping (not its real name)
  * Option Relationship Mapping
  * Pathway Mapping

### 4. [Elaboration]: Framing actions, testing our thinking & 5. [Operation]: Change as real work

[![Elaboration image][core_activities__elaboration.image]][elaboration]

An introduction to hypothesis-based change and other aspects of [Just-in-time Strategy Deployment]:

  * [Changeban] (I): A process of knowledge discovery (optional)
  * Options to experiments
  * [Experiment A3][experiment_a3]
  * [Changeban] \(II): Double loop learning (optional)

And to close:

  * Full Circle
