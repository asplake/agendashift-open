# Outside-in Strategy Review

The Agendashift Outside-in Strategy Review (OI-SR) is described in the 2019 book *[Right to Left: The digital leader’s guide to Lean and Agile]*. It comprises five sessions:

  1. Timeframe, strategic drivers/challenges, etc – with [Celebration-5W]
  2. As given in the [Outside-in Strategy Review (OI-SR) template], the **outside-in questions** – capturing objectives for each of the following five layers in turn, sequenced to expose internal contradictions when looking back up/out in the customer direction:

       1. **Customer** – “What's happening when we’re reaching the right customers, meeting their *strategic needs*<sup>1</sup>”
       2. **Organisation** – “When we’re meeting those strategic needs, what kind of organisation are we?”
       3. **Product** – “Through what products and services are we meeting those strategic needs?”
       4. **Platform** – “When we’re that kind of organisation, meeting those strategic needs, delivering those products and services, what are the defining/critical capabilities that make it all possible?”
       5. **Team(s)** – “When we’re achieving all of the above, what kind(s) of team(s) are we?”

       <sup>1</sup>*Strategic needs*: Their needs, our strategy

  3. **From Obstacles to Outcomes** – with [15-minute FOTO]
  4. **Structure a plan**
  5. **Developing options** – with [the Agendashift Experiment A3 template]

May be augemented by the Agendashift Outside-in Strategy Readiness [assessment][assessments] – an inside-out look at your capability to develop and pursue outside-in strategy.

Workshop materials are available via the [partner programme][become_a_partner].

This workshop is available for private use only. The longer workshop [Wholehearted:OKR – Integrating strategy, development, and delivery] is available both publicly and privately, and incorporates all the material of the Outside-in Strategy Review. The shorter [Impact! Story, Strategy, and Outcomes for Products and Services] concentrates on the Customer layer (and indirectly the Organisation and Product layers). Our several [Transformation Strategy Workshops] can be seen as focusing mainly on the Platform and Team(s) layers.
