# Outside-in Strategy Review

The Agendashift Outside-in Strategy Review (OI-SR) is described in the 2019 book *[Right to Left: The digital leader’s guide to Lean and Agile]*. It comprises five sessions:

  1. **Agree on a timeframe** – with [Celebration-5W]
  2. AS given in the [Outside-in Strategy Review (OI-SR) template], the **outside-in questions** – capturing objectives for each of the following five layers in turn, sequenced to expose internal contradictions when looking back up/out in the customer direction:

       1. Customer
       2. Organisation
       3. Product
       4. Platform
       5. Team(s)

  3. **From Obstacles to Outcomes** – with [15-minute FOTO]
  4. **Structure a plan**
  5. **Developing options** – with [the Agendashift Experiment A3 template]

Workshop materials are available via the [partner programme][become_a_partner].

This workshop is available for private use only. The longer workshop [Wholehearted:OKR – Integrating strategy, development, and delivery] is available both publicly and privately, and incorporates all the material of the Outside-in Strategy Review. The shorter [Impact! Story, Strategy, and Outcomes for Products and Services] concentrates on the Customer layer (and indirectly the Organisation and Product layers). Our several [Transformation Strategy Workshops] can be seen as focusing mainly on the Platform and Team(s) layers.
