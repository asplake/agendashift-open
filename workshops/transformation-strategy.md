# Transformation Strategy Workshops

The classic Agendashift workshops, following the design described in the 2018 book *[Agendashift: Outcome-oriented change and continuous transformation]*:

  * [Core Agendashift: Facilitating Outcome-Oriented Change] – learning the essential tools
  * [Applied Agendashift: Co-Creating Your Transformation Strategy] – focussed on the host organisation
  * [Agendashift Deep Dive: Coaching and Leading Continuous Transformation] – the 2-day immersion

These workshops can all be delivered online, typically over multiple days in sessions of up to two hours each. All include the [Agendashift delivery assessment as prework][assessments], input to the [Exploration] session.

## Choose your transformation strategy workshop

The transformation strategy workshops cover the Agendashift engagement model with a range of depth, coverage, and organisation focus:

### 1. [Core Agendashift: Facilitating Outcome-Oriented Change]

This 1-day workshop provides familiarisation with the Agendashift transformation strategy tools and materials and an initial introduction to outcome orientation. Its typical audience includes coaches, consultants, and managers. [More...][core]

### 2. [Applied Agendashift: Co-Creating Your Transformation Strategy]

Using the same Core material, the focus of the Applied workshop the host organisation and its ways of working. As its name suggests, its output is a coherent strategy for transformation, co-created by its participants. It is delivered either as an intensive 1-day event for a mixed audience or as a series of targetted events as part of a broader engagement. [More...][applied]

### [3. Agendashift Deep Dive: Coaching and Leading Continuous Transformation]

Expanding on the Core workshop, the 2-day Deep Dive workshop is aimed at coaches, consultants, and managers wishing to develop their coaching and leadership skills in the areas of coaching, facilitation, strategy deployment, and change leadership, and to broaden and deepen their appreciation of the Lean-Agile landscape and related bodies of knowledge.

## Public or private?

With the exception of the Applied workshop (equivalent in content to the Core workshop and private by definition), all workshops are offered both publicly and privately. Public workshops – see our [Events calendar] – emphasise approach and skills; private workshops can be targetted directely at a range of organisational needs:

  * To launch, refocus, or re-energise continuous transformation in your organisation
  * To enhance your organisation's internal coaching and change management capability
  * To support your organisation development or leadership development programme

Your workshop will be facilitated by an [Agendashift partner][partners], the majority of whom are listed in our partner directory. Our unlisted partners typically work exclusively within a single client organisation (often their employer), enabling self-service access to the full range of tools and materials.
