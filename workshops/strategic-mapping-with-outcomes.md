# Strategic Mapping with Outcomes

This 2-hour hands-on workshop covers mapping and other visualisation techniques employed in our longer workshops. In Agendashift, [Mapping] is the bridge between Agendashift’s two generative patterns:

 1. Organising outcomes generated by occurrences of the [Ideal, Obstacles, Outcomes (IdOO)] pattern and as a medium for the ongoing work of the Discovery and Exploration activities
 2. To help manage the process of [Right-to-Left Strategy Deployment], reflecting priorities and other thinking as it evolves

No quadrants or clusters will be (ab)used in this workshop!

## Exercises

Setup:

  * Challenge Mapping, bootstrapping the outcomes used in later exercises
  * [Plan on a Page], the simple visualisation used in [Discovery]

Then the “string” of exercises defined for the Mapping activity, each exercise both valuable in its own right and making its successor easier:

  * The Cynefin Four Points Contextualisation exercise (Snowden), introduced under the pseudonym Option Approach Mapping
  * Option Relationship Mapping (Keogh/Scotland, Wardley), previously known as Reverse Wardley Mapping
  * Pathway Mapping (User Story Mapping meets the Reverse STATIK model)
