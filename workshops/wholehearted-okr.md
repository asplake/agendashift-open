# Wholehearted:OKR – Bringing OKR to life with Agendashift

Objectives and Key Results (OKR) is – to use the Wikipedia definition – a framework for defining and tracking objectives and their outcomes. Done well (*[wholeheartedly][wholehearted]*), it’s a great model for participatory strategy deployment. Done badly... well let’s just say that you don’t want to do it badly! OKR joins Lean and Agile as one of those things for which the way you introduce it matters at least as much as the thing itself, placing it very much within Agendashift territory.

We know that the best outcomes aren’t just metrics or targets, but the happy endings to stories in which real needs are met. How they might be evidenced remains an important question, but a different one. With that clear separation in mind, Agendashift and OKR seem made for each other:

  * **Agendashift**: an engagement model that is strategic in outlook and resolutely needs-based and outcome-oriented in both approach and technique
  * **OKR**: an operating model for strategy deployment that emphasises alignment on outcomes and transparency around progress towards them

With this powerful combination you’ll not only avoid the potential pitfalls and dysfunctions of OKR but come away with fresh perspectives on participation, leadership, and organisation design. And if you’re already familiar with Agendashift, you’ll experience some exciting new tools for strategy and operation.

Of all our workshops, Wholehearted:OKR delivers the most complete realisation of our [wholehearted] mission. It demonstrates how to create opportunities for:

  * Authentic **engagement** on issues that matter
  * Meaningful **participation** across strategy, development, and delivery
  * Anticipating and meeting **needs**
  * **Leadership** around **outcomes** (each inviting the other)

Run this workshop within your organisation and you will be creating these opportunities as you learn. Or join a public workshop and share with other practitioners – the choice is yours!
