### 4. [Implementing your Outside-in Service Delivery Review (OI-SDR)]

A private workshop that will take you well on your way to implementing your own outside-in service delivery review (OI-SDR) as introduced in *[Agendashift]* (2018) and developed in *[Right to Left]* (2019). [More...][outside_in_service_delivery_review]

## Public or private?

With the exception of the private-only outside-in service delivery review workshop, all workshops are offered both publicly and privately.

Your workshop will be facilitated by an Agendashift partner, the majority of whom are listed in our [partner directory][partners]. Our unlisted partners typically work exclusively within a single client organisation (often their employer), enabling self-service access to the full range of tools and materials.
