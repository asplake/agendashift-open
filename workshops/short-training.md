Our third family of workshops, all 100% online, and comprising:

### 1. [Coaching with Outcomes (CwO)]

### 3. [Probe! Outcomes, Stories, and Experiments][probe]

Described by one participant as *”A3 for the 2020’s"*, the *Probe!* workshop is a standalone and enhanced version of the our strategy workshops’ [Elaboration] activity, as covered in chapter 4 of the Agendashift [book][agendashift]. It features one of our most popular resources, the [Agendashift Experiment A3 Template][experiment_a3], and exciting new material from the *[Impact!]* and [Wholehearted:OKR] workshops.

### 4. [Implementing your Outside-in Service Delivery Review (OI-SDR)]

A private workshop that will take you well on your way to implementing your own outside-in service delivery review (OI-SDR) as introduced in *[Agendashift]* (2nd edition 2021) and developed in *[Right to Left]* (2019, audiobook 2020). [More...][outside_in_service_delivery_review]

## Public or private?

With the exception of the private-only outside-in service delivery review workshop, all workshops are offered both publicly and privately.

Your workshop will be facilitated by an Agendashift partner, the majority of whom are listed in our [partner directory][partners]. Our unlisted partners typically work exclusively within a single client organisation (often their employer), enabling self-service access to the full range of tools and materials.
