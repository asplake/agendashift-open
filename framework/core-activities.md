# Core activities

[![Framework overview image][core_activities.image]][core_activities]

Agendashift’s core activities simultaneously describe:

  1. Ongoing activities required in any organisation successfully undergoing strategic levels of change
  2. The Agendashift workshop sessions designed to prime the pump for these activities

The pages below describe the core activities as workshop sessions:

  1. [Discovery]: Getting a shared sense of where we’d like to get to, identifying needs, ambitions and aspirations as well as shorter-term outcomes
  2. [Exploration]: Identifying opportunities for change, exploring outcomes in more depth
  3. [Mapping]: Visualising plans and priorities, understanding the relationships between outcomes
  4. [Elaboration]: Keeping the change process fed with ideas, framing options as hypotheses and developing them as experiments
  5. [Operation] \(covered to at most a limited extent in shorter workshops): The infrastructure of organisation design required to sustain change

The 2018 book *[Agendashift: Outcome-oriented change and continuous transformation]* is organised in the same way.

Whether as activities or sessions, the core activities can usefully be seen in turn as implementations of Agendashift’s [two key patterns][patterns], with the Mapping activity bridging the two:

  1. [Ideal, Obstacles, Outcomes (IdOO)] – the pattern repeated across Discovery and Exploration
  2. [Right-to-Left Strategy Deployment] – the pattern spanning Elaboration and Operation

The framework overview image (top) shows the core activities mapped both to the patterns and to the Agendashift [principles] \(numbered 1-5).
