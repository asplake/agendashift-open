# Exploration

**Exploration**: Identifying opportunities for change; recognising appropriate change management approaches.

As a workshop session:

[![Exploration image][core_activities__exploration.image]][exploration]

The [Core Agendashift workshop][core] includes the following Exploration exercises (with their related models/inspirations):

  * Debriefing the [Agendashift delivery assessment][assessments] (Lean and Agile)
  * Prioritisation, reflection, and obstacle identification
  * [15-minute FOTO (Classic)][15-minute FOTO] \(Clean Language)

As practiced once already in [Discovery], at the heart of Exploration is the generative pattern [Ideal, Obstacles, Outcomes (IdOO)]:

  * **Ideal** (or Ideal best): In a context already established, a lightly guided reflection on some provided or harvested *generative image* or *adaptive challenge*, here each prioritised assessment prompt. *“What’s it like when it’s working at its ideal best? What new stories could you tell?”*
  * **Obstacles**: *“What stops that? What gets in the way?”* – see also the [Language of outcomes] resource for tips on raising the quality of obstacles
  * **Outcomes**: 15-minute FOTO again (this time the Classic edition), with the resulting outcomes organised in the [Mapping] activity
