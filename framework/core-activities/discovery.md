# Discovery

**Discovery**: Getting a shared sense of where we’d like to get to, identifying needs, ambitions and aspirations as well as shorter-term outcomes.

As a workshop session:

[![Discovery image][core_activities__discovery.image]][discovery]

The [Core Agendashift workshop][core] includes the following Discovery exercises (with their related models/inspirations):

  * [Celebration-5W] – context, future focus
  * [True North] – reflection and obstacles generation (Lean and Agile)
  * [15-minute FOTO (Lite)][15-minute FOTO] – outcome generation (Clean Language)
  * [Plan on a Page] – organising outcomes (Lean Change)

This structure realises the generative pattern [Ideal, Obstacles, Outcomes (IdOO)]:

  * **Ideal** (or Ideal best): In a context established here by Celebration-5W (preceded perhaps by some context-gathering icebreakers), a lightly guided reflection on some provided or harvested *generative image* or *adaptive challenge*, here the True North statement
  * **Obstacles**: *“What stops that? What gets in the way?”*; see also the [Language of outcomes] resource for tips on raising the quality of obstacles
  * **Outcomes**: As with obstacles (and relative to them, and perhaps identifying further obstacles in the process), outcomes are generated, not prescribed. 15-minute FOTO is one way of generating them; it does it efficiently enough that they typically need organising afterwards, hence Plan on a Page.

This pattern is repeated in the [Exploration] activity and in other workshops but with different tools. Other workshops may replace any or all of the above tools but retain this same structure overall. For example, in the [Outside-in strategy][outside_in_strategy] family of workshops, the True North is replaced by the outermost one or two layers of the outside-in strategy review and their respective questions (see the [OI-SR template] for details).

Longer workshops such as [Deep Dive] and [Wholehearted:OKR] may add these and/or other related exercises or discussion topics:

   * Culture, values, and Systems Thinking (Schein)
   * Stories as expressions of strategy (Denning)
