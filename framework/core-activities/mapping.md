# Mapping

**Mapping**: Visualising plans and priorities, keeping the agenda for change visible, the bridge between Agendashift’s two [generative patterns]:

  * To organise the outcomes generated by occurrences of the [Ideal, Obstacles, Outcomes (IdOO)] pattern and as a medium for its ongoing work
  * To help manage the process of [Right-to-Left Strategy Deployment], reflecting priorities and other thinking as it evolves

[Deep Dive] workshops include the following “string” of three Mapping exercises:

  * The Cynefin Four Points Contextualisation exercise (Snowden), introduced under the pseudonym Option Approach Mapping
  * Option Relationship Mapping (Keogh/Scotland, Wardley), previously known as Reverse Wardley Mapping
  * Pathway Mapping (User Story Mapping meets Reverse STATIK)

Shorter workshops will typically use just one of the above exercises or the [Changeban] game (which covers elements of [Elaboration] and [Operation] also).

Longer workshops may introduce these and/or other related exercises/topics:

  * Impact mapping (Adzic)
  * X-Matrix (Lean) with the TASTE model (Scotland)
  * Strategy reconciliations
