# Elaboration

**Elaboration**: Keeping the process of [Right-to-Left Strategy Deployment] fed with ideas, taking options from [Mapping], framing them as hypotheses, and developing them as experiments.

The [Core Agendashift workshop][core] includes the following Elaboration exercises (with their related models/inspirations):

  * Choose an outcome
  * The Challenge Mapping questions (Challenge Mapping)¹
  * Measures of success ([2MBM])
  * Option generation and prioritisation (15% Solutions)²
  * Hypothesis (Lean Startup)
  * Experiment A3 (Lean)

Longer workshops may add these and/or other related exercises/topics in combination with topics from [Operation]:

  * [Changeban] \(Lean Startup, Kanban, Argyris)
  * Stories, requirements, and authentic situations of need (User stories, Job stories)


¹See the [Ideal, Obstacles, Outcomes (IdOO) pattern][idoo] page for some Challenge Mapping references  
²[15% Solutions: Discover and Focus on What Each Person Has the Freedom and Resources to Do Now](https://www.liberatingstructures.com/7-15-solutions/) (liberatingstructures.com), Henri Lipmanowicz and Keith McCandless inspired by Prof. Gareth Morgan
