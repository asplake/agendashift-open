# Elaboration

**Elaboration**: Keeping the process of [Right-to-Left Strategy Deployment] fed with ideas, taking options from [Mapping], framing them as hypotheses, and developing them as experiments.

The [Core Agendashift workshop][core] includes the following Elaboration exercises (with their related models/inspirations):

  * Choose an outcome
  * The Challenge Mapping questions (Challenge Mapping)
  * Measures of success ([2MBM])
  * Option generation and prioritisation
  * Hypothesis (Lean Startup)
  * Experiment A3 (Lean)

Longer workshops may add these and/or other related exercises/topics in combination with topics from [Operation]:

  * [Changeban] \(Lean Startup, Kanban, Argyris)
  * Stories, requirements, and authentic situations of need (User stories, Job stories)
