# Agendashift’s generative patterns

_”At every scope and scale, developing strategy together, pursuing strategy together, [agreement on] outcomes before solutions, working backwards from key moments of impact and learning”_

[![Agendashift patterns image][patterns.image]][patterns]

Patterns for developing and pursuing strategy in the language of outcomes:

  1. **[Ideal, Obstacles, and Outcomes (IdOO)][idoo]**
  1. **[Meaning, Measure, Method][patterns__meaning_measure_method]**
  2. **[Right-to-Left Strategy Deployment][patterns__rtl_strategy_deployment]**

At their intersection is the *agenda for change*, maintained through regular reviews of strategy and delivery.

**[Mapping]** and related techniques of visual management help to: 

  * Organise the outcomes generated in the first and as a medium for its ongoing work
  * Manage the learning process, reflecting priorities and other thinking as it evolves

Within and across these three key generative patterns can be found many other reusable patterns and principles. These are particularly important:

  * Outcomes before solutions – *agreement on outcomes before solutions* being Agendashift’s defining principle
  * Participation – both generally and across boundaries
  * Generative conversations
  * Just in time (JIT)
  * Iteration
  * Validation
  * Double loop learning
