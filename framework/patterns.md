# Agendashift’s generative patterns

[![Framework overview image][framework.image]][framework]

The patterns:

  1. **[Ideal, Obstacles, and Outcomes (Idoo)][idoo]**
  2. **[Just-in-time Strategy Deployment][jit-strategy]**

Between these, one core activity – **[Mapping][mapping]** – is shared:

  * To organise the outcomes generated in the first and as a medium for its ongoing work
  * To help manage the learning process, reflecting priorities and other thinking as it evolves
