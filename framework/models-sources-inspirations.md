# Models, sources, and inspirations


We’re working at the exciting intersection of strategy, organisation development, and (Lean-Agile) delivery – helping each other grow in scope and capability, raising our game individually and collectively. Here are some of Agendashift’s diverse sources, influences, and inspirations.

[![Working at the intersection image][models_sources_inspirations.image]][models_sources_inspirations]

Unless otherwise specified, ‘chapters’ below refer to the Agendashift book, *[Agendashift: Outcome-oriented change and continuous transformation]* (2018); its [recommended reading page][agendashift__recommended_reading] is organised by chapter.

*[Right to Left: The digital leader’s guide to Lean and Agile]* (2019) has its own [recommended reading page][right_to_left__recommended_reading]  also.

## [Discovery] and [Exploration]

See the references for chapters 1 & 2 together with the additional references included in the description of the pattern [Ideal, Obstacles, Outcomes (IdOO)]. Key influences and sources:

  * Lean, Agile, and Lean-Agile: Lean and Agile get a chapter each in Right to Left; the book as a whole provides an outcome-oriented perspective on the Lean-Agile landscape
  * Clean Language, Solutions Focus, GROW, and Toyota Kata
  * Kanban’s values model provides the primary organisation of the assessment; see [Kanban from the Inside] (2014)

## [Mapping]

See the references for chapter 3. Key influences and sources:

  * Cynefin, for the 4 Points contextualisation exercise (which we refer to by the pseudonym ‘Option Approach Mapping’ until we are ready to introduce the Cynefin model)
  * Wardley Mapping (see Right to Left chapter 5, Outside In), the inspiration for Option Relationship Mapping (Karl Scotland and Liz Keogh)
  * User Story Mapping, the inspiration for Pathway Mapping
  * Reverse STATIK, which provides a secondary organisation of the assessment and the ‘spine’ of the Pathway Map
  * X-Matrix and TASTE

## [Elaboration] and [Operation]

See the references for Agendashift chapters 4 & 5 and Right to Left chapters 4, 5 & 6 together with the additional references included in the description of the pattern [Just-in-time Strategy Deployment]. Key influences and sources:

  * PDCA/PDSA (Plan/Do/Check/Act), aka the Deming Cycle or Shewhart Cycle (our reservations about cycles notwithstanding)
  * Lean Startup, OKR, and 4DX
  * Servant Leadership (Greenleaf) and Leader-Leader (Marquet)
  * Sociocracy (aka Circular Organisation, Dynamic Governance)
  * Management Cybernetics – Viable System Model, Law of Requisite Variety, Redundancy of Potential Command etc

## Overall

We are glad also to note strong correspondences between Agendashift and recent work in the Dialogic Organisation Development community, Gervase Bushe’s model of generative change in particular. These references are likely to be found in the planned second edition of the Agendashift book:

  * *The Dynamics of Generative Change*, Gervase R. Bushe (BMI Publishing, 2020)
  * *Dialogic Organization Development: The Theory and Practice of Transformational Change*, Gervase R. Bushe and Robert J. Marshak (Berrett-Koehler Publishers, 2015)
