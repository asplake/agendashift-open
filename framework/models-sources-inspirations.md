# Models, sources, and inspirations


We’re working at the exciting intersection of strategy, organisation development, and (Lean-Agile) delivery – helping each other grow in scope and capability, raising our game individually and collectively. Here are some of Agendashift’s diverse sources, influences, and inspirations.

[![Working at the intersection image][models_sources_inspirations.image]][models_sources_inspirations]

Unless otherwise specified, ‘chapters’ below refer to the Agendashift book, *[Agendashift: Outcome-oriented change and continuous transformation]* (2nd edition 2021); its [recommended reading page][agendashift_2nd_edition__recommended_reading] is organised by chapter.

*[Right to Left: The digital leader’s guide to Lean and Agile]* (2019, audiobook 2020) has its own [recommended reading page][right_to_left__recommended_reading] also.

## [Discovery] and [Exploration]

  * Clean Language, Solutions Focus, GROW, and Toyota Kata
  * Lean, Agile, and Lean-Agile (Lean and Agile get a chapter each in *Right to Left*; the book as a whole provides an outcome-oriented perspective on the Lean-Agile landscape)
  * Kanban’s values model provides the primary organisation of the assessment; see *[Kanban from the Inside]* (2014)

See:

  * References for chapters 1 & 2
  * Additional references included in the description of the pattern [Ideal, Obstacles, Outcomes (IdOO)]


## [Mapping]

  * Cynefin, for the 4 Points contextualisation exercise (which we refer to by the pseudonym ‘Option Approach Mapping’ until we are ready to introduce the Cynefin model)
  * Wardley Mapping (see *Right to Left* chapter 5, Outside In), the inspiration for Option Relationship Mapping (Karl Scotland and Liz Keogh)
  * User Story Mapping, the inspiration for Pathway Mapping
  * Reverse STATIK, which provides a secondary organisation of the assessment and the ‘spine’ of the Pathway Map
  * X-Matrix and TASTE

See the references for chapter 3.


## [Elaboration] and [Operation]

  * PDCA/PDSA (Plan/Do/Check/Act), aka the Deming Cycle or Shewhart Cycle (our reservations about cycles notwithstanding)
  * Lean Startup, OKR, and 4DX
  * Servant Leadership (Greenleaf) and Leader-Leader (Marquet)
  * Sociocracy (aka Circular Organisation, Dynamic Governance)
  * Management Cybernetics – Viable System Model, Law of Requisite Variety, Redundancy of Potential Command etc

See:
  * References for *Agendashift* chapters 4, 5 & 6
  * References for *Right to Left* chapters 4, 5 & 6
  * Additional references included in the description of the pattern [Right-to-Left Strategy Deployment]


## Overall

We are glad also to note strong correspondences between Agendashift and recent work in the Dialogic Organisation Development community, Gervase Bushe’s model of generative change in particular. These references are likely to be found in the planned second edition of the Agendashift book:

  * *The Dynamics of Generative Change*, Gervase R. Bushe (BMI Publishing, 2020)
  * *Dialogic Organization Development: The Theory and Practice of Transformational Change*, Gervase R. Bushe and Robert J. Marshak (Berrett-Koehler Publishers, 2015)
