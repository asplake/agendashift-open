# Ideal, Obstacles, Outcomes (IdOO)

[![IdOO image][patterns__idoo.image]][idoo]

**IdOO** – a mnemonic for **Ideal**, **Obstacles**, **Outcomes** – is one of two key generative patterns in Agendashift. We use it at different times and with different combinations of tools and prompts, but still the underlying pattern easily recognised.

## Motivation

The motivation for IdOO lies in Agendashift’s first two [principles]:

  1. Start – and finish – with needs
  2. Agree on outcomes

Authentic agreement on meaningful outcomes is the most powerful enabler for strategic change that we know. IdOO promotes this by:

  * Having outcomes identified and articulated through participation in a generative process, not imposed from outside
  * Ensuring by construction that they are connected to needs

## Specific instances of the pattern

Our transformation strategy workshops [Core], [Applied], and [Deep Dive] use the IdOO pattern twice:

  * In [Discovery], reflecting on our provided [True North] statement, in a business context established by preceding exercises, and the resulting outcomes organised in a [Plan on a Page]
  * In [Exploration], reflecting on prompts prioritised from our 42-prompt [assessment][assessments], context already established in Discovery, and outcomes then organised through [Mapping]

Our various outside-in strategy review workshops employ the IdOO pattern either once or twice (see the [OI-SR template] for detail on the ‘layers’ below):

  * In the *[Impact!]* workshop, for the Customer layer (only)
  * In the [Wholehearted:OKR] workshop, initially for the Customer and Organisation layers and later the Product, Platform, and Teams(s) layers

Demonstrating IdOO at its most simple, the Agendashift [True North] deck asks the questions below in sequence, one slide at a time (the True North statement fulfulling the role of *generative image*, evoking a wide range of possible responses both spoken and unspoken):

  1. *When this is working at its ideal best for you, what’s that like?*
  2. *And when that's happening, what new stories could you tell?*
  3. *What stops that? What gets in the way?*
  4. *What would you like to have happen?*
  5. *Then what happens?* (And perhaps again: *Then what happens?*)

## Facilitating IdOO

**Ideal**: This is the result of the reflection (written down or otherwise) and should not be confused with the *generative image*, *adaptive challenge*, or other prompt – provided or harvested – used by the facilitator in the reflection’s setup. Furthermore, the reflection always comes after establishing some kind of business context.

**Obstacles**: As described in our resource [Language of Outcomes] and in particular the second article in the associated blog series, it’s important to check that obstacles identify real issues and don’t suffer from certain unhelpful framings. Their elicitation is usually straightforward – from experience we have learned to use neutral but direct language when facilitating. In certain circumstances however it may be appropriate to employ a more elaborate obstacle identification exercise.

**Outcomes**: These can be generated by various means, for example one of the two variants of our Clean Language-inspired coaching game, [15-minute FOTO], the *miracle question* as popularised by *The Solution Focus* (McKergow & Jackson), or some combination. As already indicated, outcomes can be organised in multiple ways after generation.

IdOO is not always linear. For example, although 15-minute FOTO is mainly about exploring and developing a landscape of outcomes, further obstacles may be identified in that process, and from those, more outcomes. It could be said therefore that the process builds a fractal landscape of both obstacles and outcomes.

 *  The classic coaching model [GROW] \(en.wikipedia.org) – Goal, Reality, Options, Way forward. Because we are developing strategy, IdOO departs from that highly recommended model in two key respects: 
     1. We seek to generate a landscape of outcomes – potentially a fractal landscape with further obstacles and their corresponding outcomes embedded within it – covering a range of timescales
     2. Rather than seeking to help the client towards their next actionable step, we go on to organise outcomes to reveal lines of sight between near-term opportunities, key results, medium-term objectives, and long-term goals; by their construction we can reasonably expect to find coherence here
      
 *  From the Clean Language community (to which the Agendashift community is closely aligned), the [PRO] \(cleanlanguage.co.uk) model – Problem, Remedy, Outcome – by Penny Tompkins and James Lawley. The ability to recognise the differences between the three elements of the model and to move conversations between them are certainly valuable skills. Comparing PRO and IdOO: 
     + *Problem* and *obstacle* are similar, differing perhaps more in tone than in substance
     + In IdOO, not seeking *remedies* at this stage, we are happy to gloss over them, replacing them with their respective outcomes (a strategy applicable in Clean Language coaching also). In Agendashift, potential solutions are considered later in the process, often loosely held as hypotheses and experiments. See Agendashift’s other key pattern, [Just-in-time Strategy Deployment].
     + *Outcomes* in the two models are the same.
      
 *  Challenge Mapping (Sid Parnes, Min Basadur) – broadening and narrowing with *Why* and *What*, responses captured in *How might we...?* (HMW) form:
     1. *“Why [is this an important challenge]?”* (and *“Why else?”*)
     2. *“What’s stopping us?”* (and *“What else?”*)

 * From the Lean community (to which we also align), some resonances with Mike Rother’s *Toyota Kata* have been noted. Like the *katas*, IdOO could be described as a ‘routine’ to be practiced.
