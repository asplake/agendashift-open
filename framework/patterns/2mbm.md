# 2MBM

Two patterns for the price of one: Meaning before Metric, Measure before Method. Type 1 and type 2 MBM respectively, collectively 2MBM.

2MBM doesn’t mean that metrics are bad, rather that they should come after mission and purpose and before solutions. It’s the difference between OKR done right and MBO, the latter a recipe for dysfunction.

From the blog post [#2MBM: Meaning before Metric, Measure before Method](https://blog.agendashift.com/2020/07/02/2mbm-meaning-before-metric-measure-before-method/) (blog.agendashift.com):

> So…  metrics are bad? No! As we’ll see in a moment they can be a source of healthy creativity if explored at the right time. If the first MBM translates to “not too early”, then the second translates to “not too late”. In fact, there’s “too late”, and then there’s “way too late”:
>
> * “Too late”: having a solution idea and then coming up with the metrics that it is likely to impact, justifying it on that basis
> * “Way too late”: implementing a solution idea and looking for benefits afterwards
>
> Not so much alignment as post hoc rationalisation, severely limiting the likelihood of any real learning taking place, and missing some vital input into the ideation process.
> 
> To illustrate that last point, here’s how we now facilitate ideation in Agendashift¹:
> 
> 1. Reacquaint ourselves with the outcome we’ve chosen to work on (remember that with us it’s *“outcomes all the way down”* and we haven’t even got to the bottom of that stack yet) with Challenge Mapping²
> 2. Having explored around it, identify a list of success indicators for that outcome
> 3. With the conversations of steps 1 and 2 still in the air, generate solution ideas
> 4. Select the *fantastic option*, the one most likely to significantly outperform – relative to the others and disproportionately (non-linearly) relative to its cost and risk
