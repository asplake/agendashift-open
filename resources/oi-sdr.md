# Outside-in Service Delivery Review (OI-SDR) <br><small>aka the Strategy Performance and Alignment Review (SPAR)</small>


> I was asked in a meetup last night what I would do if I could implement only one thing. Five years ago, I might have answered with <i>“Validation”</i>; today, my answer is the OI-SDR. It’s a piece of deliberate organisation design, building in the strong organisational expectation that learning will be happening – learning about our customers and learning about ourselves. An opportunity for *double loop* learning. And to do it justice, you’ll soon be practicing validation anyway!

Agendashift’s Outside-in Service Delivery Review gives a strategic and Lean-Agile twist to the classic operational review meeting. Based on experience in the UK government digital space, it was introduced in the 2018 1st edition of *[Agendashift]*, described in chapter 5 of the 2019 book *[Right to Left: The digital leader’s guide to Lean and Agile]* and futher developed in the *Agendashift* 2nd edition (March 2021).
