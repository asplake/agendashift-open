## The Language of Outcomes

Or more properly, the language of needs, obstacles, and outcomes, Agendashift’s golden thread.

The cheat sheet supersedes the old Language of Outcomes resource. The 5-part blog series that spawned it remains relevant however:

 1. [Identifying the adaptive challenge](https://blog.agendashift.com/2020/01/16/the-language-of-outcomes-1-identifying-the-adaptive-challenge/)
 2. [Framing obstacles](https://blog.agendashift.com/2020/01/21/the-language-of-outcomes-2-framing-obstacles/)
 3. [Generating outcomes](https://blog.agendashift.com/2020/01/28/the-language-of-outcomes-3-generating-outcomes/)
 4. [Organising outcomes](https://blog.agendashift.com/2020/02/03/the-language-of-outcomes-4-organising-outcomes/)
 5. [Between ends and means](https://blog.agendashift.com/2020/02/10/5-between-ends-and-means/)
