# OI-SR Outside-in Strategy Review (OI-SR) template

The OI-SR template as described in chapter 5 of the 2019 book *[Right to Left: The digital leader’s guide to Lean and Agile]* and released under a Creative Commons CC-BY-SA license.

This template is the inspiration to our [Outside-in strategy workshops]: the flagship [Wholehearted:OKR], the shorter *[Impact!]* workshop, and the generic [Agendashift Outside-in Strategy Review (OI-SR)]. Slideware for all three is included under the [Agendashift partner programme][become_a_partner].

The template’s vertical axis represents the outside-in journey from the customer inwards, with a prompt in the form of a question for each layer (see below). Its horizontal axis represents the [Ideal, Obstacles, Outcomes (IdOO)] pattern, the outcomes organised into three time horizons in the manner of the [Plan on a Page] included with the resources for [15-minute FOTO].

## The outside-in questions

1.  **Customer**: What’s happening when we’re reaching the right customers, meeting their strategic needs?
2.  **Organisation**: When we’re meeting those strategic needs, what kind of organisation are we?
3.  **Product**: Through what products and services are we meeting those strategic needs?
4.  **Platform**: When we’re that kind of organisation, meeting those strategic needs, delivering those products and services, what are the defining/critical capabilities that make it all possible?
5.  **Team(s)**: When we’re achieving all of the above, what kind(s) of team(s) are we?
