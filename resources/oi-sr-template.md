# OI-SR Outside-in Strategy Review (OI-SR) template

The OI-SR template as described in chapter 5 of the 2019 book *[Right to Left: The digital leader’s guide to Lean and Agile]*, put in context in the 2021 2nd edition of *[Agendashift: Outcome-oriented change and continuous transformation]*, and featured in our [cheat sheet][leading_with_outcomes_cheat_sheet]. It released under a Creative Commons CC-BY-SA license; translations and other adaptations welcome!

This template is the inspiration to our [Outside-in strategy workshops]: the flagship [Wholehearted:OKR], the shorter *[Impact!]* workshop, and the generic [Agendashift Outside-in Strategy Review (OI-SR)]. Slideware for all three is included under the [Agendashift partner programme][become_a_partner].

The template’s vertical axis represents the outside-in journey from the customer inwards, with a prompt in the form of a question for each of five layers (see below). Its horizontal axis represents the [Ideal, Obstacles, Outcomes (IdOO)] pattern, the outcomes organised into three time horizons in the manner of the [Plan on a Page] included with the resources for [15-minute FOTO].

## The 5 layers and the outside-in questions

> 1.  **Customer**: What’s happening when we’re reaching the right customers, meeting their *strategic needs*<sup>1</sup>?
> 2.  **Organisation**: When we’re meeting those strategic needs, what kind of organisation are we?
> 3.  **Product**: Through what products and services are we meeting those strategic needs?
> 4.  **Platform**: When we’re that kind of organisation, meeting those strategic needs, delivering those products and services, what are the defining/critical capabilities that make it all possible?
> 5.  **Team(s)**: When we’re achieving all of the above, what kind(s) of team(s) are we?
>
> <sup>1</sup>*strategic needs*: Their needs, our strategy

The questions are non-prescriptive by design, making as few assumptions as possible. Each question builds on its predecessors, supporting participants in a process of model building. Also by design, the layers, the relationships between them, and their respective questions leave room for some careful (non-prescriptive) unpacking by the facilitator.
