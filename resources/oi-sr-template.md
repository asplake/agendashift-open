# Outside-in Strategy Review (OI-SR) template

The OI-SR template as described in chapter 5 of the 2019 book *[Right to Left: The digital leader’s guide to Lean and Agile]*, put in context in the 2021 2nd edition of *[Agendashift: Outcome-oriented change and continuous transformation]*, and featured in our [cheat sheet][leading_with_outcomes_cheat_sheet]. It released under a Creative Commons CC-BY-SA license; translations and other adaptations welcome!

Workshop slideware for the Outside-in Strategy Review is included under the [Agendashift partner programme][become_a_partner]. The [Agendashift Academy](https://academy.agendashift.com") module **Outside-in Strategy: positioned for success** is based on a hands-on walk through the model and its application.

Especially if (say) visual mapping techniques will be used, the template may be regarded more as a guide to the process rather than something to be filled in.

For a given scope – team, team-of-teams, something bigger (up to whole organisation) – it poses an interesting sequence of generative questions that launch conversations of the form Ideal, Obstacles, Outcomes, in other words the [IdOO ("I do")] pattern.

An alternate version inspired by Option Relationship Mapping, Wardley Mapping, and Challenge Mapping allows for outcomes or *“How might we”s* (HMWs) to be organised on an axis of ambiguity, spreading them out so that relationships between can more easily be drawn:

The Ideal for each layer can be interpreted in various ways:

  * As describing a “compelling future”, without which the strategy would lack motivation
  * As a *“possibility-focussed purpose statement”* – see *The Dynamics of Generative Change*, Gervase Bushe (BMI Publishing, 2020)
  * As describing a *job-to-be-done* – see *Demand-Side Sales 101: Stop Selling and Help Your Customers Make Progress*, Bob Moesta, Greg Engle (Lioncrest Publishing, 2020)

For the standard version, the obstacles for each layer are *“what stops that, what gets in the way”* of that layer’s Ideal. Outcomes are generated from those and then organised.

For the alternate version, the standard process can be followed, or the *Why?* and *What stops us?* questions of Challenge Mapping used to generate *“How might we”s* (HMWs).

## The 5 layers and the outside-in questions

> 1.  **Customer**: What’s happening when we’re reaching the right customers, meeting their *strategic needs*<sup>1</sup>?
> 2.  **Organisation**: When we’re meeting those strategic needs, what kind of organisation are we?
> 3.  **Product**: Through what products and services are we meeting those strategic needs?
> 4.  **Platform**: When we’re that kind of organisation, meeting those strategic needs, delivering those products and services, what are the defining/critical capabilities that make it all possible?
> 5.  **Team(s)**: When we’re achieving all of the above, what kind(s) of team(s) are we?
>
> <sup>1</sup>*strategic needs*: Their needs, our strategy
>

The questions are non-prescriptive by design, making as few assumptions as possible. Each question builds on its predecessors, supporting participants in a process of model building. Also by design, the layers, the relationships between them, and their respective questions leave room for some careful (non-prescriptive) unpacking by the facilitator or trainer.

## The Outside-in Strategy Readiness Assessment

Developed for the [Agendashift Academy](https://academy.agendashift.com") module **Outside-in Strategy: positioned for success**, this is a short (15-prompt) assessment tool, 3 prompts for each of the abovementioned 5 layers.
